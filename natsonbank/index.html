                    Rating:⭐️<br><br>Key words: Dine-In, Brunch<br><br>I unfortunately had a bad experience yet didn’t even get through the front door! I’ve been waiting to eat here based on reviews. I booked a reservation through Resy and was confirmed for Pride Sunday brunch 1pm table of 4.  We arrived to be met with a host with an attitude saying they are not excepting reservations. I showed my confirmation email and was told that they had called all reservations and told them it would be closed and only open for drinks… I never received a call nor an email.  This was handled very poorly by the manager on duty. We were then left to find another option on a very busy weekend. Thanks so much Nat’s for making our Pride memorable.I don’t need a credit or free drinks for a future visit. You left a bad taste in my mouth and will not return.

The drinks were great, glasses were a lil wonky.  My “aguachille” tasted like a sweet gazpacho with slices of chile, not enough spice at all. Was very mid. All seafood tasted very fresh, though even the raw scallop. Service was great, honestly I should’ve gotten the seafood tower. I’ll try this spot again.

The host was jovial and we were fortunate to secure seats at the bar. The bartender was delightful, serving up a superb coffee and offering great wine recommendations. The octopus carpaccio and pear salad were simply spectacular. Overall, Nat's on Bank offers a cozy atmosphere, excellent service, and truly memorable dishes. A must-visit for anyone in the area and don’t miss their funky bathroom.

I always check the menu before I go to make sure I can eat, when I showed up what was labeled as gluten free online was not labeled as gf on their menu and they confirmed online was not accurate. I was told fries had cross contamination when in reality they said fries were dipped in beer, that’s fully gluten not cross contamination. I ended up having a burger with no bun which was fine but I wish I was able to get something else. I would encourage them to at least try to have gluten free buns, have some more gf options, and make sure their online menu is accurate.
