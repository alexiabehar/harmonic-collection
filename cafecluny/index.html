                    Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br><br>My favorite breakfast menu item so far is the avocado toast with a poached egg and side of greens. The greens were evenly and nicely marinated in a vinegar sauce. The poached egg was a fun and tasty addition to the avocado toast. The avocado spread was good, along with the toast and tomatoes. Overall it was solid but I do tend to prefer more adventurous flavors.<br><br>The steel cut oatmeal with fruit was nicely done. The coconut shreds and almond slivers helped it quite a bit and were a nice touch more than regular oatmeal with fruit. I don't think I'll get it again simply because it is huge and I don't want to spike my blood sugar so early in the morning. But some people are eating French toast with syrup for breakfast so for those people this would be an improvement in terms of blood spiking.

                    Rating:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br><br>Key Words: Dine-In, Dinner, $50-100<br><br>Came in for an early dinner during the week with a reservation. Around 5ish it wasn’t too busy. We had an outdoor reservation but switched to inside bc of the heat.<br><br>To eat we split the Caesar salad which was tiny. It tasted good, but we only got a couple of bites each. As my main I ordered one of the pasta dishes with shrimp. It was absolutely delicious. The sauce was perfectly light and lemony.<br><br>The servers were attentive and kept our drinks full. Overall it’s a cute place and I was satisfied with the experience but I can’t stop thinking about how small the Caesar was.

                    Rating:⭐️⭐️<br><br>Key Words: Dine-in<br><br>This restaurant is not very comfortable since the tables are very close together. I came here to try because it has alot of hype on social media. It was a Wednesday at around 5ish and dead so i figured we get the best service which was not the case. The food was ok,  got the hyped up dishes ive seen, chicken parm- eggplant stack, meatballs, and carbonara. I wanted to like this place due to its appeal online, but it does not live up to hype.
